**Open source mapping: Connect and work with the Tech & Innovation team at Humanitarian OpenStreetMapTeam (HOT)**

&nbsp;


27 June

15:00 - 17:00 - <https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2023/talk/QZLTXP/>

&nbsp;

Come and meet the Tech & Innovation team at the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), hear about the status of the existing and experimental open mapping tools, and explore how you can get involved!

In this side event, you will hear about the latest open source technology developments ranging from remote mapping using HOT Tasking Manager, field mapping using the Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM) to uploading imagery using Open Aerial Map, exporting OSM data using the HOT Export Tool and AI-assisted mapping with one of the most recent projects we are working on - fAIr.

We want to connect with people who are working on anything from imagery to data visualization and provide a space to get hands-on and deep-dive into the various stages of the open mapping workflow. Participants may choose any workflow they would like to focus on, and in groups, deep dive into the topic of interest. We are looking for YOUR contributions. Whatever your skills/interest might be, there will be something for YOU to input and collaborate on with our team!

**Registration**: Anyone is welcome to drop in the session! This event will be held on June 27 from 15:00.

We will reach out to you before the side event. Look forward to meeting you in person!

Whatever your technical background is, we will find an area that matches your interest! Take a look at the HOTOSM Github repos: [https://github.com/hotosm](https://github.com/hotosm)

**Petya Kangalova** is really passionate about the impact of open mapping and using technology as an enabler for people in supporting their communities. As an Open Tech Collective Facilitator at HOTOSM, I hope to be able to successfully build a dynamic collective of open tech contributors from around the world!
