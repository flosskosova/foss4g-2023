### Description

Following an established tradition, FOSS4G organizes an Academic Track which will run over the days of the Conference. The Scientific Committee of FOSS4G 2023 invites original research contributions addressing any topic or domain connected to Open Source Geospatial Software, including (but not limited to) Open Hardware, Open software development, Open GIScience, Open Geospatial Data, (Geo)Spatial Data Sharing Systems, Open (Geospatial) Cloud Platforms and Services, Open (Geo)Education, Participatory Mapping, Digital Twins, GeoAI and Geospatial Machine Learning.

All types of papers are welcome, including on results achieved, case studies, work in progress, reviews and demos. We discourage, however, mere presentations of technology or use cases without properly justifying originality against the scientific state of the art and without particular novelty. In addition, the use of open source geospatial software should be properly highlighted. Contributions from PhD students and early-stage researchers are particularly encouraged.

In the evaluation of proposals, the [Scientific Committee]({% link _pages/about/academic-team.html %}) will pay particular attention to the reproducibility of the research (where this is applicable). Reproducibility is ensured when the research makes all artefacts (input data, computational steps, methods and code) openly available to obtain consistent results. When available, the code shall be publicly released under an open source license.

### How to Submit a Paper

The submission procedure is divided in two steps.

### Step 1

At the first step authors are invited to submit abstracts written in English comprising between 800 and 1000 words and containing sufficient details for evaluation (including the approach, results, concepts, reasons why it should be considered and why it would be interesting for the FOSS4G Academic Track audience).

The contributions are evaluated in the abstract review process. Submitted abstract will be refereed by the members of the [Scientific Committee]({% link _pages/about/academic-team.html %}) for originality/scientific novelty, relevance for the FOSS4G community, presentation/clarity and overall quality.

As in all the fields of science, reproducibility will be considered among the evaluation criteria (see above). Authors will receive feedback and (for accepted abstracts)) suggestions for improvement to be used for preparing their papers, to be submitted in Step 2.

_The system for submitting abstracts will be open in January 2023._

### Requirements

If the abstract is accepted, the authors are invited to submit an extended paper that shall include original and unpublished research.

We can accept up to 2 papers per registration. If you choose this option and the two abstracts (for which only one author is registered to the conference) are both accepted, one proposal will be presented through a standard oral presentation and the other one will be presented through a poster or a 3-5 minutes lightning talk (this will be decided at a later stage). Alternatively (and based on the reviews) they can be both presented through posters. Regardless of the situation (1 oral presentation and 1 poster/lightning talk or 2 posters), the authors have to write two papers for Step 2.

Submitted papers will not be reviewed again, i.e. the acceptance of the content is solely based on the abstract. However, papers will be checked against the conformance to the template (see below).

Only the work of authors who submit the paper (conformant to the template) will be included (as talks or posters) in the Academic Track program. In other words, no presentation at the Academic Track is possible without submitting a paper.

### Step 2

Following the FOSS4G tradition started in 2018, the papers will be published again in [The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences](https://www.isprs.org/publications/archives.aspx), listed in the ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI) of the Web of Science, SCOPUS, the E/I Compendex, and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). As a reference, please find [here](https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLVIII-4-W1-2022/) the paper published for the Academic Track of FOSS4G 2022.

Please pay attention that accepted papers will be published only after checking that at least one author is registered to the conference, with the limit of maximum two papers per author (as explained above). The papers will be published online on the first day of the conference at the latest.

All papers should be formatted as per ISPRS author's guidelines (template), available here in both LaTeX and DOC versions: [isprs.org/documents/orangebook/app5.aspx](https://www.isprs.org/documents/orangebook/app5.aspx)
