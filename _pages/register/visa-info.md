Kosovo requires visas for citizens of certain countries. You can find more information on which participants will need a visa to come to Kosovo here:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Kosovo>

FLOSSK will issue a visa invitation letter should you need one and will facilitate the visa process so you don’t need to visit a Kosovo Consulate.

Approved FOSS4G 2023 participants can apply remotely for a visa in the Consulate General of the Republic of Kosovo in Istanbul, New York or Tirana.

The procedure is as follows:

- Until April 1st, all participants wanting to apply for a Kosovo visa in distance should send the first 2 pages (bio details) of their scanned passport to visa@foss4g.org along with Full Name, Date of Birth, Passport # and Country of Issue in the body of the email, and tell us whether they would like to apply in Istanbul, Tirana or New York.
- Do this as soon as possible, even if you are not sure you will apply for the visa afterwards!
- The FOSS4G local team will then send the list of potential applicants to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kosovo to get permission for you to make a remote visa application;
- Once we get approval from MFA, we will notify you to apply via email following the procedure described below. We will also provide supporting documents from the local organization, FLOSSK.
- The Visa decision usually takes 21 days from the date of the application.
- After approval of the visa, you have to options:
- The Consulate will instruct you to send your passport via post (along with any other documents they may deem necessary) for placement of the visa sticker. They will return it back to you by post.
- One other option after this procedure, if the participants are legally unable to send their passports by mail to a Kosovo consulate outside their country, physical presence at certain Kosovo consulates to receive the visa is necessary.
- In this case, once your visa is approved through the remote application, visa stamping will be on walk in.
