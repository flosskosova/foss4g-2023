### FOSS4G 2023 Studentship Programme for Western Balkans

FOSS4G is the one of most important events of the year in the geospatial world. In direct proportionality with its increasing size stands the increasing costs to organize it and, as a direct consequence, the increasing participation cost that might not be accessible to all interested.

The OSGeo community is by definition open and it has been a long standing interest of any Local Organizing Committee to make the event as accessible as possible. Prizren Local Organizing Committee is no different and that is why we would like to introduce our efforts in this direction: Studentship Program and Travel Grant!

Through Student grant, this year we will be offering 40 scholarships for participants to join the conference for free, for students coming from Western Balkan that are enrolled in a university. The Student grant will include a full conference ticket (including 2 workshop tracks), accommodation, and opportunity to volunteer.

### Criteria

The 40 special tickets will be offered to **Kosovo** and other **Western Balkans** students who:

- Are registered in any university in the Bachelor, Master and PhD level
- Have previous experience or future ambition to join the open GIS community
- Are willing to contribute half a day volunteering throughout the conference week
