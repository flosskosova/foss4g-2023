### Give back and get involved!

FOSS4G 2023 has opened a call to select a group of volunteers that will help us stay organized throughout the conference and ensure all workshops, presentations, and events run smoothly.

Getting involved with the conference will give you a unique opportunity to soak up the atmosphere in a different way. You will be playing an integral part in making the event happen and have excellent opportunities for networking with a wide range of delegates while supporting the LOC.

You will not only help us make this experience more pleasant for everyone, but will have the opportunity to work closely with all our speakers, have a chance to meet like-minded individuals well noted in the open geospatial world, while having more than 50% of the time (when not covering shifts) of the whole duration of the event to attend talks and workshops and live this unique experience.

### General information

Volunteers will be asked to work up to 20 hours throughout the conference. In exchange for their time, volunteers will have their registration fee reduced to 150 EUR. Additionally, we will cover your food and accommodation\* during your stay.

\*_The accommodation covered in the volunteer program is preassigned accommodation by the Volunteer Committee, in a double room within the venue._

The purpose of the volunteer program for FOSS4G 2023 is to be able to provide need-based affordable attendance, while striving for diversity throughout the application review process.

### Registration deadline

Registrations for volunteering will be accepted in two batches, based on the need to obtain a visa to enter Kosovo.

1. **If you need a visa to enter Kosovo**, make sure to register and send needed documents before **10 April 2023**. Check out Visa section page: <https://2023.foss4g.org/register/visa-info/> After this, we will not be able to qualify you for the volunteer program, nor assist with visa documents.

2. **If you do not need a visa to enter Kosovo**, make sure to register before **10 May 2023**.

### Accepted as a volunteer? What needs to be done?

You will be contacted by the Volunteer Committee and will be asked to sign a simple agreement on the duty with FLOSSK\* and be added to a telegram group that we will use for internal coordination before and during the conference.

Throughout the conference, there will be a series of 3, 4, and 1 hour volunteer shifts. Volunteers will be able to sign up for the available shifts that work best for them, but in order to receive the reduced registration fee a volunteer must sign up for a minimum of 15 hours and up to 20 hours in total. Shift assignments are on a first-come, first-serve basis once the sign-up is released.

Volunteers will be assuming different roles or positions for each shift they sign up for. A brief description of each of the positions we are looking for throughout the conference are below. Please make sure to arrive between 30 min before your shift starts.
