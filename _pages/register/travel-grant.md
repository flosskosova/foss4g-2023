### FOSS4G 2023 Travel Grant Programme

OSGeo provides a Travel Grant Program (TGP) to facilitate accessibility and diversity at the global FOSS4G 2023 Conference, which will happen in Prizren, Kosovo, 26 June - 2 July 2023.

The TGP is administered by the Conference Committee (CC) and supported by members of the Prizren LOC (PLOC). Applications will be accepted until 15 April 2023.

[APPLY](https://forms.gle/br7DDT7UHTpy7Lax9){: target="\_blank" .btn .btn-primary .waves-effect .waves-button .waves-light .waves-float}

### Travel Grants

The Travel Grant will include a full conference ticket (including 2 workshop tracks) and a lump-sum contribution towards travel, accommodation or other expenses.

There will be 3 different sizes of travel grants available:

1. Applicants from Kosovo, Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro: 200 EUR
2. [European Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_population) (not including countries from point 1): 400 EUR
3. Applicants from other countries : 800 EUR

The size and number of grants may be adjusted at the discretion of the Conference Committee, depending upon the level of funding raised and the number of applications received. Applicants will only be able to apply for one size of travel grant and are encouraged to apply for the smallest grant that will enable them to attend FOSS4G 2023.

Any person applying for more than one grant will be excluded from the application process.

### Criteria

In order to guarantee a transparent and fair allocation of funds, the travel grant programme uses a points system for ranking applications. Points are awarded if applicants match specific criteria. After the application phase is over, all applicants are ranked by points, and the applicants with the most points will receive funding.

Please note that the purpose of the travel grant programme is to enhance diversity at the conference. We might reserve a few programme spots for people with unique and outstanding applications. However, the majority of programme spots will solely be determined by the point ranking.

Applicants receive points for the following criteria:

#### Nationality

The allocation of points is based on the World Bank country rating by income (<https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html>).

- Applicants from Low-income economies receive 1.5 points.
- Applicants from Lower-middle-income economies receive 1 point.
- Applicants from Upper-middle-income economies receive 0.5 point.
- Applicants from High-income economies receive 0 point.

#### Residence

The allocation of points is based on the World Bank country rating by income (<https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html>).

- Applicants who are currently living in Low-income economies receive 1.5 points.
- Applicants who are currently living in Lower-middle-income economies receive 1 point.
- Applicants who are currently living in Upper-middle-income economies receive 0.5 point.
- Applicants who are currently living in High-income economies receive 0 point.

#### Gender and Minorities

In order to create a more diverse community, women and applicants from other under-represented groups will receive 1 point.

#### Students

Students in general receive 1 point. If a student also applied and is selected in the volunteer programme, 1 additional point is awarded. Phd students are considered as students.

\*Students from [Studentship Programme](/register/studentship-grant), group 1 are excluded from this grant and should consider applying for Studentship Grant for Western Balkans.

#### Submitted and Accepted Talks

ThePFLOC values applicants who are willing to contribute to the success of the FOSS4G. Therefore we award points for people who are willing to present at the conference. Only one presenting author will be eligible to receive points.

- A talk submission that is accepted earns 3 points.
- A talk submission that is not selected still earns 1 point.

#### OSGeo Software and Community

- Details of their past contributions to OSGeo projects or community activities: 3 points
- Demonstrated usage and experience with OSGeo software: 1 point

### Payment

You must be able to fund the direct costs of your travel to FOSS4G and be in possession of a valid entry visa and immunization documents (if required). Successful applicants will receive a conference pass and become eligible for reimbursement of expenses up to the limit of the travel grant when they check-in at the conference registration desk. Reimbursement of expenses will be by electronic means (details to be advised).

Only in the case of demonstrated needs and exceptional cases, the travel grant amount will be provided in advance or used to cover specific travel costs directly.

### Supporting the TGP

The travel grant program is funded through:

- Conference sponsors
- Sponsor donations, recognized as part of OSGeo sponsorship program
- Annual commitment from the OSGeo board

You can help to make FOSS4G more accessible and increase the diversity of our attendees by making a donation to the FOSS4G TGP through the PayPal account of the OSGeo local chapter that is managing the conference.
