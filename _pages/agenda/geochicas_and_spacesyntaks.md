#### GeoChicas and SpaceSyntaKs meetup

Everyone is welcome to join us to meet other women and allies attending FOSS4G 2023 who are interested in closing the gender gap and working towards diversity in our communities. We want to meet you and hear about your projects!

We'll try to break the ice and get off to a great start at FOSS4G while having fun and doing karaoke! The event will be on 27th of June starting from 19h in [GADA Restaurant](https://osm.org/go/xfigRtZRT?m=) (old Antalya) in Prizren. Drinks and food are on us ;)

The event is organized by [Geochicas](http://www.geochicas.org/) and [SpaceSyntaKs](https://twitter.com/spacesyntaks/).
