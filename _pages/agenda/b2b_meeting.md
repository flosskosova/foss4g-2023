#### Business to Business Meeting

The FOSS4G Business to Business (B2B) meeting is a chance to network and connect with businesses leveraging geospatial data and FOSS technology in their daily work. This year’s B2B will take place on June 27th from 17:00 to 20:00, just a day before the main conference starts, at ITP Prizren’s Exhibition Area, which is the focal point of the conference, and will be facilitated by the German-Kosovar Business Association (KDWV-OEGJK).

This B2B will start with welcome remarks from the KDWV-OEGJK and the German Ambassador, Mr. Jörn Rohde. Then, our sponsors will get a chance to present their businesses in a certain amount of time depending on the level of sponsorship.

During this event, there will be a comfortable space to meet and get direct contact with other participants. You will be accompanied by appetizers, food and beverages. All this happens right before the main conference starts so that you have lots more opportunities to strengthen your network! Attending the B2B conference is free for all sponsors.

We are happy to invite everybody else to buy a ticket for only 50,00 €.
