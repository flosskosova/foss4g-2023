[SpaceSyntaKs](https://fj.linkedin.com/company/space-syntaks) is an NGO based in Prishtina, founded by a community of geospatial data enthusiasts. Our work uses geospatial data and technology to tackle different urban phenomena. The work we do is organized within three broad programs: CityLab, PlaceMaking, and GeoTaggers. Most of our projects rely on open-source geospatial software to collect, analyze, and visualize data for various urban challenges. We also provide free training and learning courses for young geospatial data researchers, while working towards growing the community of open data and open software contributors.

We are very excited to partner with the FOSS4G 2023 conference's organizing team and a community dedicated to advancing open geospatial technology.
