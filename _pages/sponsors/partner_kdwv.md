The German-Kosovar Business Association (Kosovarisch-Deutsche Wirtschaftsvereinigung - KDWV) - [oegjk.org](https://oegjk.org) - is a member-driven business association that is dedicated to further strengthen bilateral ties and trade exchange between Germany and Kosovo. KDWV was founded through an initiative of the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Pristina, and currently represents 190 member companies. The Association advises, supports and represents German companies in Kosovo that are seeking to develop or expand their business activities. It also supports and advises Kosovar companies, which trade with Germany on a wide range of goods and services and creates opportunities for business and networking.

Since KDWV sits at the heart of the German business community in Kosovo, the organization plays an active role to improve the local business environment, by providing a respected voice for its members vis-á-vis the Government ensuring their priorities and concerns are heard in the corridors of power. KDWV’s opinions are regularly sought by policymakers and parliamentarians – the Association has been helping to shape Kosovo’s business agenda for more than 10 years.
