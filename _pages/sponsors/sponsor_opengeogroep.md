[The OpenGeoGroep](https://www.opengeogroep.nl/) is a Dutch cooperation of 12 freelancers and companies, that provides services, products and solutions for geo. The OpenGeoGroep distinguishes itself by offering innovative solutions based on professional Open Source Software and based on Open Standards.

Many members of the cooperation are involved in international open source and open standards communities and the development of open source software.

A huge part of our profits is spent on supporting open source software projects, either by feature development or in form of sponsoring. In 2023 we spent 25,000 euros on this.
