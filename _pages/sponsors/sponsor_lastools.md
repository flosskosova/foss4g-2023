[LAStools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/) consist of an open-source part and the LAStools software suite, a collection of highly efficient, batch-scriptable, multicore command line tools, which is available for licensing. We have tools to classify, tile, convert, filter, raster, triangulate, contour, clip, and polygonise LiDAR data. All tools can also be run stand-alone via our native GUI **laslook**, a new graphical workbench which is available for free download, and are available as toolboxes for ArcGIS, QGIS, FME and ERDAS IMAGINE.

LAStools are the fastest and most memory efficient solution for batch-scripted multi-core LiDAR processing and can turn billions of LiDAR points into useful products at blazing speeds and with low memory requirements. For seamless processing of large amounts of LiDAR, we further offer the BLAST extension of LAStools.

Our award-winning open-source LiDAR compressor [LASzip](https://laszip.org/) has become the de facto industry standard for compressed LiDAR.
