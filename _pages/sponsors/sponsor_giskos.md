We are [giskos.com](https://giskos.com/), a boutique software and geo-information house.

With nearly 20 years of experience with tech strategy, design, and delivery, we are experts in designing
and developing your idea to turn it into a product that users will love and continue to use. We achieve
high quality and speed through our standards and accelerators.

We started our journey in 2003 in Prishtina, the capital of Kosova, South-East Europe. Initially, we
focused heavily on Geographic Information Systems (GIS), but over the years, we expanded our services
catalog, and we are now primarily a software house focusing on spatially and data-centric products.

We are based in downtown Prishtina, and our clientele is exclusively international. We work at the
intersection of software development, data management, location intelligence, and mapping.
