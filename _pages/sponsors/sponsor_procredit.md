As a bank that encourages innovation and supports initiatives that enable professionals to gathering knowledge and ideas from top-notch local, regional, and international experts, we are pleased to sponsor the FOSS4G 2023 conference in Prishtina.

**Who we are:** [ProCredit Bank](https://procreditbank-kos.com/eng/homepage/) is a development-oriented commercial bank. We offer excellent customer service to small and medium enterprises and to private individuals who have the capacity to save and who prefer to do their banking through electronic channels. In our operations, we adhere to several core principles: We value transparency in our communication with our customers, we promote a saving culture, we strive to minimize our ecological footprint, and we provide services which are based both on an understanding of each client’s situation and on sound financial analysis.

We’re looking forward to being part of these seven days of workshops, presentations, discussions, and cooperation at FOSS4G 2023.
