At [Cloud68.co](https://cloud68..co), we are excited to support the 2023 edition of the FOSS4G conference, the well established international conference on Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial technologies (FOSS4G). As a sponsor, we are committed to promoting open-source technology and supporting the geospatial community.

Our team will be supporting the event in various ways, including providing reliable digital infrastructure with open-source tools, which is also our expertise. We believe that FOSS4G plays a vital role in advancing the use of open-source geospatial software, and we feel honored to support the event and the organizing team in their mission to make this edition a great meeting of all the open source GIS community.

Our participation and support to the FOSS4G organizing team reflects our commitment to making the migration from big tech to open-source platforms hassle-free. We understand the importance of open-source technology in the geospatial industry and are proud to contribute to its growth in any way we can.

We are excited to meet all the community members and learn from other FOSS GIS professionals, and are looking forward to meeting you at an event and city that is close to our hearts and ethos. See you in Prizren!
