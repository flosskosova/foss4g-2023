We are pleased to sponsor the FOSS4G 2023 conference in Prizren, Kosovo. We are interested to discuss with open-source solution providers and startups developing new innovations in the field. We are working to create interoperable solutions for Europe and to contribute to the creation of European data spaces.

_Who are we?_

**GeoE3**

GeoE3 project is a cross-European project, promoting geospatially enabled ecosystem for Europe. It is co-financed by the Connecting Europe Facility of the European Union. By enabling the Open Public Data Digital Service Infrastructure, we in GeoE3 have been developing and testing services to better serve the European citizen by enhancing the availability, interoperability, and integration of geospatial data and services. Check out our data platform [geoe3platform.eu/geoe3](https://geoe3platform.eu/geoe3/) and visit [our website](https://geoe3.eu/) to read more.

**Location Innovation Hub**

The Location Innovation Hub (LIH) is a centre of excellence in location information coordinated by the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute. LIH services are produced in conjunction with our partner network. Our customers are especially companies who want to solve the challenges of digitalisation and strengthen their competitiveness. We also serve the public sector. Our customers can make their operations more efficient by developing data interoperability and using precise positioning and next generation navigation technologies. We produce tools and test environments, and provide consultation, training, and support through networking for companies to obtain funding. One of our test environments will be the GeoE3 data integration platform. [Visit our website](https://www.locationinnovationhub.eu/).

We wish you all a great conference!
