We are pleased to sponsor the FOSS4G 2023 conference in Prizren. Our team is eager to meet again in real life with other community members and end-users. We want to make sure the conference exceeds people’s expectations. That’s why we don’t hesitate to step up and support to make it happen!

[GeoCat](https://www.geocat.net/) focuses on the development of Spatial Data Infrastructures that support you, as a geospatial expert in your day-to-day job. Making sure your data is fit to be shared or combined with data from other sources. Assisting governments and companies to comply with national or international agreements and legislations like INSPIRE as well as ISO and OGC standards that facilitate data exchange. We provide our Enterprise products and services to a wide range of National and International government agencies, like National Mapping Agencies and Ministries as well as Municipalities and Provinces. GeoCat provides both expertise and training, Enterprise ready open source software solutions with Long Term Support agreements and an Enterprise SAAS solution providing an advanced geospatial backbone for your organisation.

With our commitment to FOSS4G 2023 we hope to make the conference an even bigger success and lower the barrier for participation. As director of GeoCat and founder of GeoNetwork opensource I am so proud, excited and happy that my team is committed to support FOSS4G 2023 with a Silver sponsorship. I wish you all a great conference! Please talk to us about job opportunities or about how we can help you with your implementation and operational challenges.
