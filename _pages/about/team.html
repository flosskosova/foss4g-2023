            <p class="text-left animated hiding" data-animation="fadeInUp" data-delay="0">
                FLOSSK has a long experience in organizing conferences, starting with Software Freedom
                Kosova in 2009. <a target="_blank" href="https://sfk.flossk.org/">Software Freedom Kosova</a> is an
                annual international conference held in Kosovo organized to promote Free/Libre and open-source software,
                free culture, and an open society. Every year, SFK brings together developers and software users,
                artists, entrepreneurs, and leaders to collaborate, learn and share common interests in the field of
                open technology through a combination of lectures, training, and workshops.

                FLOSSK has also organized the <a target="_blank" href="https://sotmsee.org/">State of the Map
                    Southeastern Europe</a> 2019 conference. State of the Map Southeastern Europe was a three-day
                conference held at the Innovation and Training Park in Prizren which brought together stakeholders in
                the OpenStreetMap and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) ecosystem. Around 150 mappers, software
                developers, academicians, NGOs, business leaders, and users of OpenStreetMap from the US and Europe came
                together to create opportunities for knowledge exchange, networking, and partnerships.
