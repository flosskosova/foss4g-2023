### Security

###### I'm concerned about security. How should I behave?
Kosovo is a fairly safe country. Summer festivals and international events in Kosovo are usually very safe and inclusive towards many groups, such as the LGBTIQ+ community, as is FOSS4G 2023. There are also a lot of people from the community living and working in Kosovo and the number of incidents is relatively low. Women can travel alone and there aren’t any specific laws against the LGBTIQ+ community. Nevertheless, there is a level of homophobia and transphobia among the population, accompanied by verbal harassment, which participants from the community should be prepared for. Queer relationships are still taboo in Kosovo and some partners might view public display of affection as dangerous in Kosovo. It is advised that LGBTIQ+ participants stay close to the conference venue and close to the group during day trips and visits to the city center.
