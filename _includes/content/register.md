### Travel grant

#### FOSS4G 2023 Travel Grant Programme

OSGeo provides a Travel Grant Program (TGP) to facilitate accessibility and diversity at the global FOSS4G 2023 Conference, which will happen in Prizren, Kosovo, 26 June - 2 July 2023. While the pandemic is still not over, we hope to bring as many participants together as the funds and health regulations will allow. Given the circumstances, the program will also dedicate a portion of the budget available to support remote attendance (e.g. by providing access to reliable internet connection) for those who will not be able to travel to Kosovo because of imposed restrictions, travel costs, or other reasons.

The TGP is administered by the Conference Committee (CC) and supported by members of the Prizren LOC (PLOC). Applications will be accepted until 12 March 2023.

#### Travel Grants

The Travel Grant will include a full conference ticket (including 1 workshop) and a lump-sum contribution towards travel, accommodation and other expenses.

There will be 3 different sizes of travel grants available:

- Applicants from Southeast Europe : 200 EUR
- Applicants from [Schengen area, European Union countries and the UK](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-visa_en) : 400 EUR
- Applicants from other countries : 800 EUR

The size and number of grants may be adjusted, at the discretion of the Conference Committee, depending upon the level of funding raised and the number of applications received. Applicants will only be able to apply for one size of travel grant and are encouraged to apply for the smallest grant that will enable them to attend FOSS4G 2023.

Any person applying for more than one grant will be excluded from the application process.

#### Criteria

In order to guarantee a transparent and fair allocation of funds, the travel grant programme uses a points system for ranking applications. Points are awarded if applicants match specific criteria. After the application phase is over, all applicants are ranked by points, and the applicants with the most points will receive funding.

Please note that the purpose of the travel grant programme is to enhance diversity at the conference. We might reserve a few programme spots for people with unique and outstanding applications. However, the majority of programme spots will solely be determined by the point ranking.

Applicants receive points for the following criteria:

##### Nationality

The allocation of points is based on the World Bank country rating by income (<https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html>).

- Applicants from Low-income economies receive 1.5 points.
- Applicants from Lower-middle-income economies receive 1 point.
- Applicants from Upper-middle-income economies receive 0.5 point.
- Applicants from High-income economies receive 0 point.

- Applicants who are currently living in Lower-middle-income economies receive 1 point.

##### Students

##### Submitted and Accepted Talks

ThePFLOC values applicants who are willing to contribute to the success of the FOSS4G. Therefore we award points for people who are willing to present at the conference. Only one presenting author will be eligible to receive points.

- A talk submission that is not selected still earns 1 point.

##### OSGeo Software and Community

Successful applicants will receive a conference pass and become eligible for reimbursement of expenses up to the limit of the travel grant when they check-in at the conference registration desk. Reimbursement of expenses will be by electronic means (details to be advised).

Only in the case of demonstrated needs and exceptional cases, the travel grant amount will be provided in advance or used to cover specific travel costs directly.

#### Supporting the TGP

The travel grant program is funded through:

- Conference sponsors
- Sponsor donations, recognized as part of OSGeo sponsorship program

Approved FOSS4G 2023 participants can apply remotely for a visa in the Consulate General of the Republic of Kosovo in Istanbul, New York or Tirana.

The procedure is as follows:

- Until April 1st, all participants wanting to apply for a Kosovo visa in distance should send the first 2 pages (bio details) of their scanned passport to visa@foss4g.org along with Full Name, Date of Birth, Passport # and Country of Issue in the body of the email, and tell us whether they would like to apply in Istanbul, Tirana or New York.
- Do this as soon as possible, even if you are not sure you will apply for the visa afterwards!
- The FOSS4G local team will then send the list of potential applicants to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kosovo to get permission for you to make a remote visa application;
- Once we get approval from MFA, we will notify you to apply via email following the procedure described below. We will also provide supporting documents from the local organization, FLOSSK.
- The Visa decision usually takes 21 days from the date of the application.
- After approval of the visa, you have to options:
- The Consulate will instruct you to send your passport via post (along with any other documents they may deem necessary) for placement of the visa sticker. They will return it back to you by post.
- One other option after this procedure, if the participants are legally unable to send their passports by mail to a Kosovo consulate outside their country, physical presence at certain Kosovo consulates to receive the visa is necessary.
- In this case, once your visa is approved through the remote application, visa stamping will be on walk in.
- Neighboring Albania allows visa free entrance for citizens of India, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and Thailand.
