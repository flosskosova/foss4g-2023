The Local Organizing Committee have the pleasure to invite you to participate in and contribute to FOSS4G 2023 which will be held on 26th of June to the 1st of July 2023, at Prizren, Kosovo.

Sponsors are the backbone of the FOSS4G Conference. With their valuable support, we, the Local Organizing Committee, are able to set up this major event that the entire geospatial community is awaiting.

Delivering a successful and inclusive FOSS4G is dependent upon support from OSGeo businesses and partners. Your organisation will receive exposure with key decision makers in the open source geo community of businesses and users.

We offer potential sponsors many different ways of supporting the event.
