# Project Zeppelin / GDG DevFest 2014 site template

## About

Project Zeppelin allows you to setup awesome GDG DevFest site in 5 minutes.

Project is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - simple, blog-aware, static site generator. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your website from GitHub’s servers for free. [Learn more about Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Template is brought by [GDG Lviv](http://lviv.gdg.org.ua/) team.

## Local development

Check if you have [all requirements for local environment](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
To install all development dependencies install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).

```cmd
gem install bundler
```

and run next command from root folder:

```cmd
bundle install
```

To start Jekyll run:

```cmd
jekyll serve -w
```

Site will be available at <http://127.0.0.1:4000/> or <http://localhost:4000/>

**NOTE:** in this mode all changes to html and data files will be automatically regenerated, but after changing ```_config.yml``` you have to restart server.

### Sass(Compass) support

**Note:** You need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)

To watch changes of `.sass` files and compile it to the `.css` on a fly change property `safe: true` to `safe: false` in `_config.yml`.
**Note: It works only on local machine, because GitHub runs Jekyll in `--save` [mode](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#configuration-overrides)**

Learn more about Sass development from [documentation](https://github.com/gdg-x/zeppelin/wiki/Sass-development).

```cmd
compass watch
```
