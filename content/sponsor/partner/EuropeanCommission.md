description: "The European Commission is honoured to be part of the global community of open source geospatial enthusiasts gathering from September 27 to October 2 at the online FOSS4G 2021 conference. The European Commission is contributing to the event with a half-day dedicated track on Friday, October 1.

The European Commission is continuing the partnership with the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo), centred around the shared values of openness, transparency, reuse and reproducibility applied to all dimensions, from data to software and standards.

The Commission’s activities around FOSS4G are naturally flowing from its recently renewed Open source software strategy 2020-2023 entitled ‘Think Open’, which identifies open source software solutions as key building blocks to deliver better European services and enrich society, in addition to actively committing to support open source developer communities. This strategy builds on other important initiatives including the European interoperability framework and the European strategy for data, whereby open source software helps ensure interoperability and technological sovereignty in key societal areas at the European scale.

The European Commission is a strong user and supporter of open source geospatial software in a multitude of domains, for example statistical production, environment, agriculture, transport, education, research and smart cities. A well-known example is INSPIRE, the pan-European spatial data infrastructure which strongly relies on open source components."
