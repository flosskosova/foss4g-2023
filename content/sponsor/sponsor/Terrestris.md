We focus in particular on the processing and presentation of spatial data with geo-information systems (GIS) in all its forms. We concentrate on the requirements of our customers and provide solutions tailored to their specific needs. In our projects we use proven and widely used open source technologies as a basis, but we are also involved in several Open Source Geospatial projects such as Open Layers, GeoStyler, MapProxy or SHOGun.
These conditions allow us to develop and offer unbiased solutions that actually satisfy all our customersâ€™ requirements. In our view, this is also the basis of our fair and transparent customer relationship. We understand our role as technology- provider, that helps customers to answer their geospatial questions.
