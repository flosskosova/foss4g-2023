OSGeo Oceania's purpose is to support and grow the Open Source Geospatial and OpenStreetMap communities in the Oceania region. The Oceania region includes the geographic region made up of Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Over the past few years OSGeo Oceania has delivered two in-person conferences in Melbourne (2018) and Wellington (2019), and pioneered a hybrid online/in-person event in 2020, with hubs organised in cities across the region, from Perth in the west to Rarotonga in the east. We also support the Open Source Geospatial and OpenStreetMap communities through microgrants for events, travel grants for conference attendance and the ‘Good Mojo Fund’ to facilitate further education.
OSGeo Oceania is proud to sponsor the 2021 FOSS4G Conference in Buenos Aires and looks forward to participating virtually from across the ocean.
