Makepath was founded in February 2020 in Austin, Texas, by Brendan Collins and Pablo Fuentes. A key vision of makepath is to help create a world that is more interconnected and aware by helping people visualize what is hiding in their data. This is largely made possible by leveraging libraries and tools that make up the broader open source GIS ecosystem.
Brendan is an expert in data science and geospatial technology. He has worked with many of the worldâ€™s leading organizations including NASA, Samsung, The World Bank, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and USAID. He is also an active contributor and core developer on several open source projects, including Datashader and Bokeh. He most recently he created the Xarray-Spatial library for large scale spatial analysis.
Pablo is a product designer and technology leader. He heads up the design and development of custom products and applications, with a focus on beautiful and usable visualizations of large datasets.
makepath is committed to increasing awareness, access and support of important open source libraries for geospatial applications. This is part of a broader focus on giving back to our local community, through monthly community service projects from each member of the makepath team.
