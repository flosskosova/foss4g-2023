Kartoza (Pty) Ltd was founded in July 2014 by Tim Sutton and Gavin Fleming. It was formed by merging Tim’s company Linfiniti Consulting (founded 2008) and Gavin’s company Afrispatial (founded 2010). Both Gavin and Tim began their GIS journeys in the mid to late 1990s.
Kartoza is registered in and operates from South Africa. All our twenty staff work remotely and are based in several centres in South Africa, Portugal, Indonesia, Tanzania, Malaysia and Madagascar.

Thanks to the Internet, we have global reach. We service clients both locally in South Africa and in the world beyond. We have twenty staff with diverse backgrounds and nationalities. We also make use of subcontractors, both local and from beyond our borders, to help us deliver larger projects.

The majority of Kartoza staff are technical and have a GIS, IT, computer science or engineering background.
Kartoza’s core business areas are:

- Desktop GIS software development (QGIS, C++, Python)
- Web application development and hosting
- GIS consulting, including Spatial IT system design and implementation
- Software Support
- FOSS GIS training

Our clients include governments, multinationals, large and small NGOs, private companies and individuals.

We have a rich track record of delivering quality, impactful solutions in many sectors, including agriculture, land information, biodiversity and conservation, spatial data infrastructures (SDI), health information, disaster risk reduction, tourism, energy and electrification planning, municipal asset management, remote sensing of water quality.

We also participate in and contribute to numerous open source projects and their communities--notably QGIS--and maintain several popular Docker projects, notably kartoza/docker-postgis, kartoza/docker-geoserver and kartoza/docker-osm.
