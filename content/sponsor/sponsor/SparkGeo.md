Sparkgeo started over a decade ago to “put maps on the internet”. Largely, we are doing the same thing now. We are a remote-first team of geospatial experts who use cloud technology to deliver massively scalable solutions for hard problems. We feel that open source technology is critical and that basic knowledge of our planet is a wealth that should be shared. We work in a wide variety of non-traditional geospatial markets from automotive to finance, because we know that geospatial is everywhere.
