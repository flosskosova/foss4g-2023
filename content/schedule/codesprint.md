The traditional OSGeo community sprint will be held after the online conference, on Saturday October 2nd, 2021.

Participation will be free of charge and anyone involved or interested in getting involved in OSGeo community projects is welcome to attend. Conference registration is not a prerequisite for participation in the code sprint.

You can choose to contribute to one or more projects. There’s always plenty to do - and it’s not all about programming. Translation, documentation, feedback, discussions, and testing are very important for projects!

Please, register at: https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2021/Community_sprint

We look forward to seeing you there!
