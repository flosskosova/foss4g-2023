A code sprint is usually organized by a group that is using an open source project and wants to see something done. The communication that happens from face to face hacking usually lasts the project for a year or more. The codesprint on FOSS4G is already a tradition we want to foster.

In order to promote the power of our community of contributors, we will include the codesprint within the main conference week. By having the code sprint in the main venue during the conference we want to encourage all members of the community to contribute while attending the conference.
