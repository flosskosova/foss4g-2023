We will repeat the successful formula of having a Pub Race map to meet close to the venue. Besides those “GeoBeers”, we planned:

### Gala Dinner
On Thursday night we will host the Gala Dinner at the “Floralis Genérica”, a huge flower sculpture in the United Nations Square. 

This meeting will be organized as a traditional (folkloric) party “Peña” to share the rich Argentinian culture with the attendees. To ensure that everybody enjoys and is entertained, we will provide tango and folklore dance classes for those who like dancing. There will be varied local food, such as empanadas, locro, asado and the indispensable “mate” to drink.
We will provide spaces for both partying and talking, so attendees with diverse social needs can interact and build networks. 

### IceBreaker
On Wednesday, there will be an unstructured and informal meeting. It will be an after office craft beer gathering in the garden rooftop of the venue. We will offer light drinks and food to close the very first day relaxed and together.
