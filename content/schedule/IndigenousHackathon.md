The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Indigenous Alliance in partnership with Space4Innovation is announcing the Indigenous FOSS4G Hackathon 2021: a hackathon by and for Indigenous communities. The challenges of the hackathon will be co-designed by Indigenous communities from around the world during a series of pre-hacks.

The Indigenous FOSS4G Hackathon 2021 will take place virtually on October 1-2, 2021. Everyone is welcome to participate. Join Indigenous communities in co-designing their own culturally appropriate ICT solutions using open source data and tools to address the challenges they face.

The Indigenous FOSS4G Hackathon 2021 will help maximise the social benefits of open data
and tools by:

 * Increasing awareness of Indigenous Peoples' specific data needs and priorities;
 * Promoting the use of open EO data among Indigenous communities to address local
issues;
 * Improving and strengthening Indigenous/local culture through the use of open EO
data and ICTs; and
 * Improving cross-cultural communication between local communities, the FOSS4G
community and data providers.

### FAQs

#### What’s a virtual hackathon?

A virtual hackathon is a hardware and software marathon that takes place online.  You will have 38 hours to work towards solving a pressing challenge co-designed by Indigenous communities around the world. 
#### What tools can I use?

Any programming language and any solution, as long as it is open source. You will be asked to share your final output code on Github. The quality of the code will not be judged in order to allow participants to focus on creating innovative and culturally relevant applications. 

#### What is the format of the product that participants will deliver?

At the end of the challenge, all participants will be asked to upload their solutions to the Eventornado platform. They will be asked to present a 2-minute video uploaded to YouTube explaining their application and to write a short description of their solution and share their code via GitHub. More information and instructions will be sent to you after you sign up.

#### How will the judging work?

Each entry will be evaluated by a jury of Indigenous leaders on the following criteria:
Societal Value: Does it offer a real solution with potential impact on the societal challenge being tackled?
Originality / Novelty: Has it been tried or done before?
Feasibility / Sustainability: Does the idea have a realistic chance of being implemented?
Usability and user interface: Is the proposed application user-friendly?
#### Who can participate?

Everybody is welcome from artists and designers to remote sensing specialists. You don’t need to have a background in programming, GIS or remote sensing to participate. 
#### Is this event free?

Yes! Just remember to register in advance. 
#### How will remote participants join in?

Further information and instructions to join the SLACK workspace will be sent to you after you register.
