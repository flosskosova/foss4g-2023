# Invitation to submit your work

Welcome to the Call for Presentations FOSS4G Buenos Aires 2021!

The global FOSS4G is the flagship event of OSGeo and one of the most 
important global geospatial events of the year. While the focus
of the conference revolts around open source software, it is a 
meeting point where knowledge and experiences are shared, 
new tools are learned and new relationships are established.

If you have developed an open source project related to geospatial
technologies, if you implemented a FOSS4G solution or product, or 
participated in a project that uses open source software, we invite
you to participate in **FOSS4G Buenos Aires 2021: Come hell or high water, FOSS4G**.

You can submit three types of contributions: 
* #### [talks]({{< ref "/call-for-papers/talks.md">}}) 
* #### [workshops]({{< ref "/call-for-papers/workshop.md">}}) 
* #### [academic papers](/call-for-papers/academic.html)

## General guidelines for all submissions

OSGeo is an open, grassroots, dynamic community and its flagship event has inherited its profound characteristics. There are no formal indications when preparing your contribution for FOSS4G, yet please consider the following suggestions: 

- FOSS4G’s backbone is open source, so make sure you clearly indicate what is (are) the open source project(s) essential in your talk; 

- If you talk of new developments or a completely new open source project, please make sure you point to its repository(ies). You’ll be speaking in a room full of geeks with computers and high-speed internet.

- The more suitable the selections of general and particular topics, and level of technical complexity are, the better shaped the final program will be. So, please, help us optimize your time at FOSS4G 2021.

- We believe in equality, so all presenters have the same exact amount of time to present their work – 20 minutes for the talk, 5 for Q&A and 5 for changing rooms. Please consider that when preparing your slides.

- And last, but not least, the success of this event lies in the responsable actions of all participants and organizers alike. If after 
you have confirmed participation, you or the co-authors are no longer able to present, please let us know as soon as possible.
