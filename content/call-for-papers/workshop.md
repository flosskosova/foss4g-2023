Workshops should showcase current and emerging FOSS4G technologies, foster skills development and provide a direct interaction between
our highly proficient OSGeo community and the public who wants to acquire new competences. Workshops are hands-on sessions in which attendants have the chance to learn a specific FOSS4G software package through problem solving.

Each workshop will take 4 hours. 

When submitting a workshop, use the abstract to make the scope and the contents clear. If possible, include the list of topics you want to cover and links to data and tutorials that will be used. 

You will be asked to indicate the level: 
from 1 – beginner to 4 – highly advanced and the minimal knowledge that the atendees should have.
