Talks will be assigned a 30 minutes slot: 15 minutes for the talk, 10 for Q&A, and 5 minutes for presenters to set up and the audience to change rooms as desired.
The talks should be presentations of use cases and/or FOSS4G products: all about how you use open source geospatial software, how it helps to solve your company/organization problems, a new development you are involved in and what it has improved, etc.
Submissions of proprietary software products will not be accepted even if they make use of free software. 

When submitting a talk, you will be asked to select a general theme (_Track_) that best defines your contribution:

- Software development;
- Transition to FOSS4G;
- Use cases & applications;
- Education & research;
- Open data

and a particular one (_Topic_): 

- Software status / state of the art, new software/project development, benchmarking;
- FOSS4G implementations in strategic application domains: land management, crisis/disaster response, smart cities, population mapping, climate change, ocean and marine monitoring, etc.;
- Data visualization: spatial analysis, manipulation and visualization of geospatial data;
- Data collection, data sharing, data science, open data, big data, data exploitation platforms;
- Sensors, remote sensing, laser-scanning, structure from motion;
- New trends: IoT, Indoor mapping, drones - UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), Artificial intelligence - machine learning, deep learning-, geospatial data structures, real time raster analysis;
- Open and reproducible science;
- Standards, interoperability, SDIs;
- Community & participatory FOSS4G;
- FOSS4G at governmental institutions;
- FOSS4G in education;
- FOSS4G for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG);
- FOSS4G for Public Health;
- Business products powered by FOSS4G

Next, you will need to assign between **1** to **4** indicating the level of technical complexity of your contribution. 

**1** means that your audience can have minimal technical knowledge related to your submission’s subject to understand it, **4** means that your audience must be highly technical to get the most out of your talk. 

Furthermore, you are encouraged to give indication of resources (video, papers etc.) to read in advance, that will help get up to speed on advanced topics. 
 
## Selection process

For submitted talks, the selection timeline is as follows: 

|Close call for talks | Community voting opens | Community voting closes | Accepted talks announced	| Full FOSS4G 2021 program |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 30/03/2021 |  03/04/2021 | 10/04/2021 | 30/04/2021 | 10/05/2021 |

FOSS4G is the international geospatial community’s event, thus the main selection of talks will be done through the open community voting process. The highest-scored ones will automatically be included in the program, while the others will be reviewed by the FOSS4G 2021 Buenos Aires volunteer Program Committee. Its members will make sure that the conference program will be well-balanced, diverse and they will make sure that every OSGeo project will have a “State of ” kind of presentation.
