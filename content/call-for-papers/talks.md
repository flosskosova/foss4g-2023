Talks will be assigned a 30 minutes slot: 15 minutes for the talk itself, 10 for Q&A, and 5 minutes for presenters to set up and the audience to change rooms as desired.

## Talk

Talks are presentations of use cases and/or FOSS4G products, i.e., all about how you use open source geospatial software, how it helps to solve your company/organization problems, a new development you are involved in and what it has improved, etc.

Submissions promoting restricted licensed software will not be accepted. This is a FOSS conference and FOSS is the main interest.

## Submitting a Proposal

When submitting a talk, you will be asked to select a general _Track_ that best defines your contribution:

- Software development;
- Transition to FOSS4G;
- Use cases & applications;
- Education & research;
- Open data

### Topic

You will have to select one of the topics that best describe your proposal. Examples of topics are:

- Software status/state of the art, new software/project development, benchmarking;
- FOSS4G implementations in strategic application domains: land management, crisis/disaster response, smart cities, population mapping, climate change, ocean and marine monitoring, etc.;
- Data visualization: spatial analysis, manipulation and visualization of geospatial data;
- Data collection, data sharing, data science, open data, big data, data exploitation platforms;
- Sensors, remote sensing, laser-scanning, structure from motion;
- New trends: IoT, Indoor mapping, drones - UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), Artificial intelligence - machine learning, deep learning-, geospatial data structures, real time raster analysis;
- Open and reproducible science;
- Standards, interoperability, SDIs;
- Community & participatory FOSS4G;
- FOSS4G at governmental institutions;
- FOSS4G in education;
- FOSS4G for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG);
- FOSS4G for Public Health;
- Business products powered by FOSS4G

### Technical Complexity

Next, you will need to assign a number between **1** and **4** indicating the level of technical complexity of your contribution. 

**1** means that the audience can have minimal technical knowledge related to your submission’s subject to understand it, **4** means that your audience must be highly technical to get the most out of your talk. 

### Requirements

Furthermore, you are encouraged to give indication of resources (video, papers, etc.) to read in advance, that will help get up to speed on advanced topics. 
 
## Timeline

|Close call for talks | Community voting opens | Community voting closes | Accepted talks announced	| Full FOSS4G 2021 program |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 19/04/2021 |  24/04/2021 | 15/05/2021 | 30/05/2021 | 30/06/2021 |

FOSS4G is the international geospatial community’s event, thus the main selection of talks will be done through the *open community voting* process. The highest-scored talks will automatically be included in the program, while others will be reviewed by the FOSS4G 2021 Buenos Aires volunteer Program Committee.

We will make sure that the conference program will be well-balanced and diverse. Moreover, the Program Committee will work hard to sure that every OSGeo project has its proper representation. If you are part of some FOSS project and want to propose a special session like a "State of the Art" session, contact us to make sure we consider the proposal carefully.
