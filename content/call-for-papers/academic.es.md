# Academic GeoForAll Track (co-organized by ISPRS and OSGeo) 

## DESCRIPTION

Following an established tradition, FOSS4G organizes an Academic Track which will run over the days of the Conference. FOSS4G invites original research contributions, scientific papers dealing with Open Geospatial Software, Open Hardware, Open GIScience, Open Geospatial Data, Spatial Data Sharing Systems, Open (Geo)Education, Participatory Mapping, Digital Twin Earth. All types of papers are welcome, such as on results achieved, case studies, work in progress, and demos. We discourage, however, mere presentations of technology or use cases without properly justifying originality against the scientific state of the art and without particular novelty.

## SUBMISSION

The submission procedure is divided in two steps. 

### **Step 1**

At the first step authors are invited to submit abstracts written in English comprising 800-1000 words and containing sufficient details for evaluation (including the approach, results, concepts, reasons why it should be considered and why it would be interesting for the audience). 
The contributions are accepted on the abstract blind review process. Submitted abstract will be refereed for originality/scientific novelty, relevance for the FOSS4G community and overall quality by the academics and researchers from the Scientific Committee. Authors will receive feedback and suggestions for improvement to their papers to be submitted in step 2.
We are happy to announce we can accept up to 2 contributions per registration. If you choose this option and the abstracts are both accepted as good quality by reviewers, one proposal will be an oral presentation, the second one will be a poster (it will be decided based on the reviews). Alternatively (and based on the reviews) they can be both posters. Regardless of the situation (1 oral presentation and 1 poster or 2 posters), in this case, the authors have to write two papers for the Step 2. 
If the abstract is accepted, the authors are invited to submit the corresponding paper dealing with original and unpublished research. 

### **Step 2**
The papers will be published in “The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences”. Please pay attention that accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings after the verification of the registration of authors to the conference (at least one author for two papers). The Proceedings will be available at the first day of the Conference.
All papers should be formatted as per ISPRS author's guidelines, available here:  https://www.isprs.org/documents/orangebook/app5.aspx
