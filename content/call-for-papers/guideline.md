On this article you will learn how to send proposals to our Call for Participation.

## Types of Submission

You have three different types of submissions you can do, each on its own url:

 * Workshop: this covers the hands-on sessions to learn new skills
 
https://callforpapers.2021.foss4g.org/foss4g-2021-workshop/

 * General: this covers the general track and contains talks, panels, benchmarks,...
 
https://callforpapers.2021.foss4g.org/foss4g2021/

 * Academic: this track will cover peer reviewed submissions
 
https://callforpapers.2021.foss4g.org/foss4g-2021-academic/

For each type of submission there may be slightly different questions, but the process is pretty similar.

## Create user and login

Once you choose the proper call for participation, you need an account to send proposals.

## Create a new Submission

Once you are logged in, you can submit a proposal by clicking first on the `Go to CFP` and then on the `submit a proposal` button.
 
### Step 1

- Submission Title

Write the title of the proposed *talk* or *workshop*. 

![Submission Title](/images/pretalx/submission_title.png)

This title should summarize the content of your submission. Try to be concise and straight to the point.

- Abstract 

In the abstract make sure to write all important elements of your proposal.

![Submission Abstract](/images/pretalx/abstract.png)

Please be concise, you have 400 words. This is what your potential audience will read to decide if they go to your session.

You can use the *preview* tab to see the final result of the content writen, in case of using markdown:

![Abstract Preview](/images/pretalx/abstract_preview.png)

- Description 

This is where you extend the abstract. This is where you may add bibliography or information that can help your audience get into context.

 - Record the talk

We have a check-box to mark that you are not interested in having your presentation recorded. As the conference is going to take place online, this may mean we will not be able to select your presentation.

![Checkbox to accept recording of the session](/images/pretalx/dont_record.png)

If you want to record your talk, **just leave unchecked**. When you accept to being recorded, you accept that FOSS4G will be able to publish your presentation and use it as advertising material for future FOSS4G events.

- Additional speaker

If you have co-speaker(s), i.e., other participant(s) that will give the talk together with you, please **add their email address** here, and we will invite them to create an account.

### Step 2

- Authors and Affiliations

You can fill now the authors of this submision in the desired order. 

Format is: *Last name, First name* for each author of the contribution. Don't forget to let us know the affiliations of each participant, just as we show in the example below:

![List of Authors](/images/pretalx/Authors.JPG)

- Track

This is the general theme that matches your talk. If more than one track fits your submission, please, choose the one that fits better. This will help our reviewers on the curation process.

![Select Track](/images/pretalx/track.png)

- Topic

Select the specific topic that best defines your contribution:

![Select Topic](/images/pretalx/topic.png)

As with the track, more than one topic may fit your submission. Please, choose the one that better defines it.

- Level

It is pretty important to be sincere on this drop down. You want your audience to have the proper skill level for your presentation. This will also help us curate a better schedule with balanced sessions.

- Requirements for the Attendees

This is where you hint your attendees if they should prepare something prior to your session. Specially important for workshops.

Ok, almost done... let's keep going!
