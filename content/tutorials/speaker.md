## Preparations

There are some tasks to help prepare for the event. You will get assigned a session leader that will contact you **before the 1st of August**. If that doesn't happen, contact the organization to let us know you still didn't have the proper speaker training.

You should have the following ready:

 * Check **when** your talk is going to take place. 
     - Make sure timezones are clear.
     - Make sure you will be available for the talk.
     - You should connect at least 20 minutes before your talk.
 * Make sure you have the following ready
     - Stable network connection (minimum 5Mbps). Better by wire.
     - Microphone
     - Camera
     - Updated browser (Chromium or Firefox better)
 * If you want to share a video, make sure you let your session leader know about it

If there's any issue and you may not be on time for your slot or your network connection is not stable enough, you have to send a video **before 30th of August** with your recorded talk, so we can play it instead. The video must be no longer than 20 minutes.

## During the Event

Speakers will log into *Streamyard* with the provided link and wait for their Moderator instructions. The Moderator may or may not be your Session Leader, but they will be waiting for you.

### Strict schedule

You must be very strict with the schedule and make sure there are no delays on your talk. This is relevant not only to allow attendees to change rooms easily but also to edit and publish the videos later.

Remember that all talks will follow a strict 20 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes of Q&A.

### Interacting with the audience

Your Moderator will pass the questions and comments from Venueless to you. You don't have to worry about following them, just focus on your presentation.
