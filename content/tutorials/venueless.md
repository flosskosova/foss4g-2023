#### Profile

Once you login for the first time, you have to fill your profile. 

First, fill your name and lastname. This is the name you will use to interact with the rest of the attendees.

Then, you may want to upload a photo. This photo will be visible to all attendees of the conference, make sure you choose one according to the professional profile you want to be associated with. It is perfectly fine not to use a photo if you want to keep your privacy. But if you are interested in interacting with other attendees, uploading a photo here will help.

Finally, there are some other fields to complete your profile. There is no mandatory field to fill, but it is important that you use the proper keywords if you want to have meaningful interactions during the conference. 

All attendees are listed at the [*Meet your Peers!*](https://2021-foss4g.venueless.events/rooms/220fb82a-6269-4f7f-8dbb-8da7a0bee67f) tab. You will be listed there as well with all the details you filled up on your profile.

You can always fill the data back later by either clicking on your name at the bottom left of the page, or going directly to your [preferences](https://2021-foss4g.venueless.events/preferences). 

##### Direct Messages

Anywhere you see someone's name you can open their profile. There, you can choose if you want to send a text **message**, request a video **call** or **block** them so they can't interact with you anymore. 

![Message Call Block](/images/tutorials/privateMessages.png "")

A blocked user cannot send any direct messages to you and you cannot send any direct messages to them. You can always unblock them later.

If you feel the need to block someone, check our [Code of Conduct](/about/coc.html). If that person is failing to follow it, let us know so we can act on it before they make someone else uncomfortable.
