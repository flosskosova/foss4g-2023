## Preparations

There are some tasks speakers are expected to complete to be prepared for the event. You will get assigned a session leader that will contact you **before August 1st**. If that doesn't happen, contact the organization to let us know you didn't get the speaker training.

You should have the following ready:

 * Check **when** your talk is going to take place. 
     - Make sure timezones are clear.
     - Make sure you will be available for the talk. If not, you have to provide a pre-recorded video of your talk.
     - You should connect at least 10 minutes before your talk.
 * Make sure you have the following ready:
     - Stable network connection (minimum 5Mbps). Better by wire.
     - Microphone
     - Camera
     - Updated browser (Chromium or Firefox better)
 * If you want to share a video, make sure you let your session leader know about it

If there are any issues and you cannot be on time for your slot or your network connection is not stable enough, please contact your session leader and send a video with your talk **before August 30th**, so we can play it instead. The video must be no longer than 20 minutes.

You can use our official [resources](/attending/template.html).

## During the Event

Speakers will log into *Streamyard* with the provided link and wait for their Session Leader instructions. 

### Strict schedule

You must be very strict with the schedule and make sure there are no delays on your talk. This is relevant not only to allow attendees to change rooms easily but also to edit and publish the videos later.

Remember that all talks will follow a strict 20 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes of Q&A.

### Interacting with the audience

Your Session Leader will pass the questions and comments to you. You don't have to worry about them, just focus on your presentation. 

## StreamYard

This is where you login as a speaker to stream your content.

You should have been provided with a login URL that starts with *https://streamyard.com/* and ends with a token.

**Do not share this link with anyone or you may be blocked from the event.**
