## Preparations

There are some tasks to hel prepare for the event.

### Contact Speakers

You should contact all the speakers in your session **before the 1st of August**. Organize a video meeting with them to check the following (you can use this list during the meeting):

 * **When** their talk is going to take place. 
     - Make sure timezones are clear.
     - Let them know they should be there at least 20 minutes before their talk.
 * **Where** their talk is going to take place. You have to provide them with the link to connect.
 * Test the platform to make sure everything works fine:
     - Microphone
     - Camera
     - Share screen/slides
     - If they want to share a video, check the sound and the framerate
 * What is their preferred form of contact if something goes wrong (they don't show up, there are technical issues). Telegram? Matrix? Phone?

If there's any issue and they may not be on time for their slot, they should send a video **before 30th of August** with their recorded talk, so we can play it instead. The video must be no longer than 20 minutes.

You may want to send a calendar invitation with all the details just to make sure they don't forget anything.

## During the Event

Speakers will log into *Streamyard* with the link you provide them and Moderators will log into both *Venueless* and *Streamyard*. 

### Strict schedule

You must be very strict with the schedule and make sure there are no delays or speed ups on your session. This is relevant not only to allow attendees to change rooms easily but also to edit and publish the videos later.

Remember that all talks will follow a strict 20 minutes of presentation, 5 minutes of Q&A and 5 minutes of buffer to change from one speaker to the next.

### Interacting with the audience
