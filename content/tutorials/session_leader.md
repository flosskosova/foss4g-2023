## Preparations Before the Event

There are some tasks to help prepare for the event. If you can't finish them on time, please let us know so we can plan ahead.

### Contact Speakers

You should contact all the speakers in your session **before the 1st of August**. Organize a video meeting with them to check the following (you can use this list during the meeting):

 * **When** their talk is going to take place. 
     - Make sure timezones are clear.
     - Let them know they should be there at least 20 minutes before their talk.
 * **Where** their talk is going to take place. You have to provide them with the link to connect.
 * Test the platform to make sure everything works fine:
     - Microphone
     - Camera
     - Share screen/slides
     - If they want to share a video, check the sound and the framerate
 * What is their preferred form of contact if something goes wrong (they don't show up, there are technical issues). Telegram? Matrix? Phone?

If there's any issue and they may not be on time for their slot, they should send a video **before 30th of August** with their recorded talk, so we can play it instead. The video must be no longer than 20 minutes.

You may want to send a calendar invitation with all the details just to make sure they don't forget anything.

### Introductions 

A moderator should prepare who each speaker is to give a proper introduction before they start presenting. You can use the data from the schedule, but read at least once who they are and be prepared.

### Questions for Speakers

Although not mandatory, it is always a courtesy to prepare one or two questions for each speaker in your session in case there are no questions from the audience.

### Backup Moderator

As this is an online event, there may be problems that may prevent you from moderating the session. It would be good if you can find a backup person that can cover you in case you can't make it. We will have a pool of candidates to cover any issues, but as there may be more than one incident at the same time, it is always better to have someone explicitly watching if you enter your session.

## During the Event

Speakers will log into *Streamyard* with the link you provide them and Moderators will log into both *Venueless* and *Streamyard*. 

Please, be online and ready at least 20 minutes before the starting time of your session.

### Strict schedule

You must be very strict with the schedule and make sure there are no delays or speed ups on your session. This is relevant not only to allow attendees to change rooms easily but also to edit and publish the videos later.

Remember that all talks will follow a strict 20 minutes of presentation, 5 minutes of Q&A and 5 minutes of buffer to change from one speaker to the next.

### Interacting with the audience

Venueless has a built-in feature for Q&A as described above. Use it to pass the comments and questions from the audience to your speakers. Keep both Venueless and Streamyard open at all times to check the streaming is working. 

**Remember to mute the tab on Venueless once the streaming starts so you don't hear the sound twice.**
