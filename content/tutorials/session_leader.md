The software stack for this event has two separated components: one for speakers and one for attendees.

## Preparations Before the Event

There are some tasks to help prepare for the event. If you can't finish them on time, please let us know so we can plan ahead.

### Contact Speakers

You should contact all the speakers in your session **before the 1st of August**. Organize a video meeting with them to check the following (you can use this list during the meeting):

 * **When** their talk is going to take place. 
     - Make sure timezones are clear.
     - Let them know they should be there at least 20 minutes before their talk.
 * **Where** their talk is going to take place. You have to provide them with the link to connect.
 * Test the platform (described on the following sections) to make sure everything works fine:
     - Microphone
     - Camera
     - Headphones or earbuds to avoid audio echoes
     - A recent version of Chrome or Firefox
     - Share screen/slides
     - If they want to share a video, check the sound and the framerate
 * What is their preferred form of contact if something goes wrong (they don't show up, there are technical issues). Telegram? Matrix? Phone?

If there's any issue and they may not be on time for their slot, they should send a video **before 30th of August** with their recorded talk, so we can play it instead. The video must be no longer than 20 minutes.

You may want to send a calendar invitation with all the details just to make sure they don't forget anything.

### Introductions 

A moderator should prepare who each speaker is to give a proper introduction before they start presenting. You can use the data from the schedule, but read at least once who they are and be prepared.

### Questions for Speakers

Although not mandatory, it is always a courtesy to prepare one or two questions for each speaker in your session in case there are no questions from the audience.

### Backup Moderator

As this is an online event, there may be problems that may prevent you from moderating the session. It would be good if you can find a backup person that can cover you in case you can't make it. We will have a pool of candidates to cover any issues, but as there may be more than one incident at the same time, it is always better to have someone explicitly watching if you enter your session.

## During the Event

Speakers will log into *Streamyard* with the link you provide them and you will log into both *Venueless* and *Streamyard*. As session leader your responsability is to both help speakers and attendees interact and make sure the streaming looks good here. Keep both open at all times.

**Remember to mute the tab on Venueless once the streaming starts so you don't hear the sound twice.**

Please, be online and ready at least 20 minutes before the starting time of your session.

### Strict schedule

You must be very strict with the schedule and make sure there are no delays or speed ups on your session. This is relevant not only to allow attendees to change rooms easily but also to edit and publish the videos later.

Remember that all talks will follow a strict 20 minutes of presentation, 5 minutes of Q&A and 5 minutes of buffer to change from one speaker to the next.

## StreamYard

This is the platform where **speakers** will present the talks.

#### Adding content to the Streaming

You can easily add and remove video pieces from the bottom list of available options to the streaming.

Try to minimize the amount of content on the stream. If it is not the slot of some speaker, don't add them until their slot starts.

#### Selecting the visualization

You can choose different visualization modes and depending on the type of the content (panel, presentation with single speaker or with multiple speakers) you can decide to use a different mode.

It is recommended to select a mode that shows multiple faces when making the introduction of the speaker, specially if there are more than one speaker.

But if there are slides, slides are usually the most important thing on screen:

Remove yourself from the streaming once the speakers start talking.

#### Banners

As an optional thing, you can add and remove banners from the streaming. You can find this option on the right menu.

For example you may want to add a banner with the presentation title during the first minute of each presentation to give context to your sudience.

Hovering over the banner will show you the option to show it on the streaming.

![](/images/tutorials/streamYardBanner2.png "")

Hovering again on the same place will show you the option to hide it on the streaming.

Some moderators find it useful to show the questions from the audience using banners as the speaker answers them. But this is not a mandatory thing, we want to give moderators free will to experiment with what they are comfortable with.

### Check the brand

The brand is the style used on the streaming. Make sure the selected brand is the FOSS4G brand.

## Venueless

This is the place where attendees will watch the conference.

### Interacting with the audience

Venueless has a built-in feature for Q&A as described above. Use it to pass the comments and questions from the audience to your speakers. Keep both Venueless and Streamyard open at all times to check the streaming is working. 

### Technical Issues

//TODO

If you face any technical issue we don't know how to solve, contact us.
