The software stack for this event has two separate components: one for speakers and one for attendees.

## Preparations Before the Event

There are some tasks that session leaders should complete to prepare for the event. If you can't finish them on time, please let us know so we can plan ahead.

### Contact Speakers

You should contact all the speakers in your session **before August 1st**. Organize a video meeting with them to check the following (you can use this list during the meeting):

 * **When** their talk is going to take place. 
     - Make sure timezones are clear.
     - Let them know they should be there at least 20 minutes before their talk.
 * **Where** their talk is going to take place. You have to provide them with the link to connect.
 * Test the platform (described on the following sections) to make sure everything works fine:
     - Microphone
     - Camera
     - Headphones or earbuds to avoid audio echoes
     - A recent version of Chrome or Firefox
     - Share screen/slides
     - If they want to share a video, check the sound and the framerate
 * What is their preferred contact channel if something goes wrong (they don't show up, there are technical issues). Telegram? Matrix? Phone?

If there are any issues and they can not make it on time for their slot, they should send a video **before August 30th** with their recorded talk, so we can play it instead. The video must be no longer than 20 minutes.

Send an email with the information at the end of your meeting with all the information. You may also want to add a calendar invitation with all the details just to make sure they don't forget anything.

### Introductions 

A Session Leader should prepare a short bio of each speaker in the session to give a proper introduction before they start presenting. You can use the data from the schedule, but read at least once who they are and be prepared.

### Questions for Speakers

Although not mandatory, it is always a courtesy to prepare one or two questions for each speaker in your session in case there are no questions from the audience.

### Backup Session Leader

As this is an online event, there may be problems that may prevent you from moderating the session. It would be good if you can find a backup person that can cover you in case you can't make it. We will have a pool of candidates to cover any issues, but as there may be more than one incident at the same time, it is always better to have someone explicitly watching if you enter your session.

## During the Event

Speakers will log into *Streamyard* with the link you provide them and you will log into both *Venueless* and *Streamyard*. As session leader your responsability is both to help speakers and attendees interact and make sure the streaming looks good. Keep both open all the time, i.e., Venueless and Streamyard.

**Remember to mute the tab on Venueless once the streaming starts so you don't hear the sound twice.**

Please, be online and ready at least 20 minutes before the starting time of your session.

### Strict schedule

You must be very strict with the schedule and make sure there are no delays or speed ups on your session. This is relevant not only to allow attendees to change rooms easily but also to edit and publish the videos later.

Remember that all talks will follow a strict 20 minutes of presentation, 5 minutes of Q&A and 5 minutes of buffer to change from one speaker to the next.

## StreamYard

This is the platform where **speakers** will present the talks.

Each room has an email associated you can use to login on *https://streamyard.com/login*. 

Streamyard will then ask you for a code you can find on https://groups.google.com/g/foss4g2021_session_leaders/ If you don't have access to this platform, let us know.

Make sure you use the code associated to the room you want to log in. Remove that message after using the code.

### Entering the Broadcast Studio

Once you login to Streamyard, you will see a list of possible Broadcasts. Use the "Enter Studio" button for the one related to the room you want to broadcast.

**Once you are ready to start streaming, don't forget to *Go Live* to start the broadcast.**

![](/images/tutorials/streamyardGoLive.png "")

Before clicking on that button, nothing will be shown to the attendees. If you don't click that button, the session will not start on Venueless.

**At the end of the session, don't forget to *End Broadcast* to stop the streaming.**

#### Link for the speakers

Select the broadcast your speaker is going to participate and send them the link to join. You can use the email option that generates automatically an email with the link.

### Using the platform

#### Adding content to the Streaming

You can easily add and remove video pieces from the bottom list of available options to the streaming.

![](/images/tutorials/streamYardAddToStream.png "")

Try to minimize the amount of content on the stream. If it is not the slot of some speaker, don't add them until their slot starts.

#### Selecting the visualization

You can choose different visualization modes and, depending on the type of content (panel, presentation with single speaker or with multiple speakers) you can decide which mode to use.

It is recommended to select a mode that shows multiple faces when introducing a speaker, especially if there are more than one speaker.

When there are slides, slides are usually the most important thing on screen:

Remove yourself from the streaming once the speaker(s) start talking.

#### Banners

As an optional thing, you can add and remove banners from the streaming. You can find this option on the right menu.

For example you may want to add a banner with the presentation title during the first minute of each presentation to give context to your audience.

![](/images/tutorials/streamYardBanner1.png "")

Hovering over the banner will show you the option to show it on the streaming.

![](/images/tutorials/streamYardBanner2.png "")

Hovering again on the same place will show you the option to hide it on the streaming.

![](/images/tutorials/streamYardBanner3.png "")

Some Session Leaders find it useful to show the questions from the audience using banners as the speaker answers them. But this is not mandatory, we want to give Session Leaders free will to experiment with what they are comfortable with.

### Check the brand

The brand is the style used on the streaming. Make sure the selected brand is the **FOSS4G brand**.

## Venueless

This is the place where attendees will watch the conference. You can learn how to use it on [the tutorial for speakers](speaker.html).

### Interacting with the audience

Venueless has a built-in feature for Q&A as described above. Use it to pass the comments and questions from the audience to your speakers. Keep both Venueless and Streamyard open all the time to check if the streaming is working properly. 

### Technical Issues

Here are some quick fixes for your technical issues.

#### I accidentally deleted the broadcast or I can't find it in Streamyard

There should be a backup broadcast you can use defined on the same account. Make sure you give the new link to all your speakers in the session and that you warn us on info@foss4g.org so we fix the broadcast list.


#### Streamyard is not working

If you are experiencing issues on Streamyard, you can use the *"Having issues?"* link to open a chat and ask for technical assistance.
