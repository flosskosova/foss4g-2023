Buenos Aires is a very affordable city. 

An attendee that stays at a 3 star hotel room spends less than $40/day on accommodation, transport and food. There are hundreds of possible accommodations less than 30 minutes to or from the venue. The average menu price is US$7,90.

We will publish a list of recommended accomodations soon.
