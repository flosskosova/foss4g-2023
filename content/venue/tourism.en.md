#### Eating in Buenos Aires: much more than meat
The gastronomic offer of Buenos Aires reflects its history of port city.
Starting with **asado**, the national ritual of grilled meats. You'll find options for all budgets, from choripan (a sausage sandwich you buy in a kiosk) to wagyu meat. Also you'll find that **parrillas** (barbeque restaurants) include, in addition to the various cuts of beef (roast, vacuum, matambre, entrail, tail of the rump, chorizo ​​steak, and more, more, more), chicken, pork, cheese (provoleta), vegetarian barbecue and much more (chorizo, black pudding, chinchulines, sweetbreads).
Empanadas (throughout the city), locro (especially in Mataderos) or dulce de leche (the main ingredient of national desserts) are also typical of the country's food.
Due to the Italian influence, the city makes a cult of pizza, of all varieties and with great tradition, all along Corrientes Avenue (from Las Cuartetas near the Obelisk to Imperio in Chacarita) and for Spanish origins there is also a cult to fish, shellfish, tortillas (Av de Mayo is the Kingdom of Spanish Cuisine with places like El Globo and El Imparcial).
As a destination for migrants from all over the world, in Buenos Aires it is possible to find ethnic restaurants of all origins: from African peanut sauce from El Buen Sabor to Uruguayan chivitos from La Pasiva, from Korean kimchi from Bi Won to Polish pierogis from Lo de Antosh, everything is possible in a city that does not sleep and where it is not uncommon to find kitchens open until midnight.
And the best way to end a good dinner is visiting any of the traditional or modern porteño ice cream parlors, trying from Sambayón de El Vesubio ice cream (founded in 1902) or Dulce de Leche de Cadore to Fernet's ice cream with Coca or of Alchemy's Gin Tonic.

También es típico de la comida del país las empanadas (en toda la ciudad), el locro (especialmente en Mataderos) o el dulce de leche (el ingrediente principal de los postres nacionales).
Por la influencia italiana la ciudad hace un culto a la pizza, de todas las variedades y con gran tradición todo a lo largo de la Avenida Corrientes (desde Las Cuartetas cerca del Obelisco hasta Imperio en Chacarita) y por los orígenes españoles también hay un culto al pescado, los mariscos, las tortillas (Av de Mayo es el Reino de la Cocina Española con lugares como El Globo y El Imparcial).

#### Entre copas: Malbec, Craft beer y el boom de la coctelería
Wine is the national drink, and Malbec, especially from Mendoza, its main representative. In a wide range of prices it is possible to find, both in bars and restaurants (even by the glass) and in supermarkets (which sell alcohol until 10 pm), very good wines, which in addition to Malbec include Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot, Tannat and Tempranillo (the special wine for the first registered to the Conference) among the most popular reds and Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Torrontés (typical of Salta, in the north of the country) among the whites.
As in many countries of the world, in Buenos Aires for years there has been a boom in craft beer (and with an incipient but growing supply of craft cider), with local production of all varieties you can enjoy in informal and pleasant premises throughout the city, which often include outdoor spaces.
As for cocktails, the national production of spirits is at a peak, marked by the rise of the local Gin (Príncipe de los Apostoles, Heráclito y Macedonio, Buenos Aires Gin, La Salvaje) with many varieties and great quality, by a growing presence of national vermouth (from the traditional Italian Fernet of which more than 90% is consumed in Argentina to new expressions such as Lunfa, Único or La Fuerza, which even has its own Bar in Palermo). Buenos Aires bars present extremely diverse experiences (from the steampunk atmosphere of Verne in Palermo, to the relaxation of 878 in Villa Crespo, from the dozen of Arcades in El Destello to the innovation of Florería Atlántico, from the classic cocktail bar available from 4 in the afternoon of Chabrés to the Tiki cocktail bar in Oh'No Lulu).


#### Culture in the birthplace of Tango: theater circuits, cultural centers, bookstores and cafes
Buenos Aires has an important cultural proposal at night, with a traditional theatrical circuit on Corrientes avenue and an Independent Theater circuit scattered throughout the City. There is also a network of Cultural Centers throughout the City, with samples, performances, musical recitals and other activities.
The most emblematic music in the city is Tango, and in San Telmo, Puerto Madero and other points of Buenos Aires it is possible to listen to this music live, as well as take classes and dance tango all night at very low prices.

#### From dusk till down: from after office to after hour
Every night of the week there is nightlife in the city until sunrise (especially in San Telmo, Palermo and Recoleta), although the local circuits are more numerous from Thursday to Sunday, starting at the end of bussines ours in the financial heart from the City (with pubs such as Kilkenny or Puerto Pirata as traditional places), continuing with bars and restaurants, to end the night in discos of all kinds (from those dedicated to Latin music, to those focused on electronic music or rock and pop from the 80s and 90s) after midnight and until late in the morning (ideal time to “go down” with a hamburger, a hot dog or a shawarma).

#### Buenos Aires: capital of diversity
Buenos Aires is one of the Latin American cities that has a circuit of bars, clubs and other entertainment and nightlife venues geared towards the LGTTBQI+ community, with epicenters in San Telmo and Palermo and an important concentration on Córdoba avenue, which includes from Cultural Centers like Casa Brandon to discos like Amérika.
