FOSS4G is the international edition of the FOSS4G; the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial conference of [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/). With more than 15 years of experience, the annual FOSS4G conference is the largest global gathering for geospatial software. FOSS4G has been held all over the world and draws attendees from all over the world. 

FOSS4G brings together developers, users, decision-makers and observers from a broad spectrum of organizations and fields of operation. Through six days of workshops, presentations, discussions, and cooperation, FOSS4G participants create effective and relevant geospatial products, standards, and protocols.

## FOSS4G 2021 Buenos Aires

The 2021 edition will be hosted for the first time on South America with the close collaboration of the GeoLibres Association.

Each FOSS4G has its special aura, wisely and kindly crafted by each Local Organising Committee, sharing the local culture and spirit with the greater community. It is a lovely feeling to bring your friends to your home, to show a glimpse of your country, to have a drink and a good talk in your favourite pub. We have made wonderful friends all over the world attending global and regional FOSS4Gs and we are eager to return the pleasure to our friends, as well as to make new ones that will carry on this tradition.
 
We understand and cherish the importance of FOSS4G for giving voice to the daring new ideas and developments in perfect harmony with the pillars of what open source for geospatial is, and thus we promise  workshops, talks and keynotes that will provoke your mind and give you hope for a better future. 

With that in mind, visit our website regularly for new updates on how your event is shaping up!
