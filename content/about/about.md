FOSS4G means Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial. 


## The conference

Organized by [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/) and with more than 15 years of experience, this international anual gathering of location enthusiasts is the largest global gathering for geospatial software. 

FOSS4G brings together developers, users, decision-makers and observers from a broad spectrum of organizations and fields of operation. Through six days of workshops, presentations, discussions, and cooperation, FOSS4G participants create effective and relevant geospatial products, standards, and protocols. 

### Our Vision

We are living on difficult times and the role of FOSS is essential for the sustainability and development of many day to day activities. From simple family communication to the development of new platforms for education and geoscience, FOSS today is the key to success.

### Innovation

We understand and cherish the importance of FOSS4G for giving voice to the daring new ideas and developments in perfect harmony with the pillars of what open source for geospatial is, and thus we promise  workshops, talks and keynotes that will provoke your mind and give you hope for a better future. 

With that in mind, join our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/gxPUJH) for new updates on how our event is shaping up!

## OSGeo

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation was founded to support and build the highest-quality open source geospatial software. The foundation's goal is to encourage the use and collaborative development of community-led projects, data development and education. Many projects live under the [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/) umbrella.


## Geolibres

Geolibres is a non-profit organization that has the goal of promoting the creation and use of geographic data with free access, the adoption of geographical standards, and the use of free software and open source for the development of geospatial information capabilities through actions that encourage and strengthen the geomatic community. 

Geolibres gives the legal framework to some of the geospatial communities in Argentina, such as [Geoinquiet@s Argentina](https://geoinquietos.org/) (OSGeo local chapter), OSM Argentina and GeochicasOSM.


### Focus on Buenos Aires

The 2021 edition will be focused for the first time on South America with the close collaboration of the GeoLibres Association in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

A FOSS4G with focus on the City of Buenos Aires undoubtedly marks a milestone in the calendar of international conferences. The city is a cultural benchmark in the region, making it a great opportunity to bring the free software communities of South America closer together. This approach will help strengthen ties between communities by fostering the exchange of experiences.
