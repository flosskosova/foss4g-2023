## The conference
FOSS4G is the international edition of the FOSS4G; the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial conference of [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/). With more than 15 years of experience, the annual FOSS4G conference is the largest global gathering for geospatial software. FOSS4G has been held all over the world and draws attendees from all over the world. 

FOSS4G brings together developers, users, decision-makers and observers from a broad spectrum of organizations and fields of operation. Through six days of workshops, presentations, discussions, and cooperation, FOSS4G participants create effective and relevant geospatial products, standards, and protocols.

## FOSS4G 2021 Buenos Aires
The 2021 edition will be hosted for the first time on South America with the close collaboration of the GeoLibres Association.

Each FOSS4G has its special aura, wisely and kindly crafted by each Local Organising Committee, sharing the local culture and spirit with the greater community. It is a lovely feeling to bring your friends to your home, to show a glimpse of your country, to have a drink and a good talk in your favourite pub. We have made wonderful friends all over the world attending global and regional FOSS4Gs and we are eager to return the pleasure to our friends, as well as to make new ones that will carry on this tradition.
 
We understand and cherish the importance of FOSS4G for giving voice to the daring new ideas and developments in perfect harmony with the pillars of what open source for geospatial is, and thus we promise  workshops, talks and keynotes that will provoke your mind and give you hope for a better future. 

With that in mind, visit our website regularly for new updates on how your event is shaping up!

## OSGeo
The Open Source Geospatial Foundation was founded to support and build the highest-quality open source geospatial software. The foundation's goal is to encourage the use and collaborative development of community-led projects, data development and education. Many projects live under the [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/) umbrella.


## Geolibres
Geolibres is a non-profit organization that has, among it's goals the purpose of promoting the creation and use of geographic data of free access, the adoption of geographical standards, the use of free software and open source for the development of geospatial information capabilities, through actions that encourage and strengthen the geomatic community. Geolibres gives the legal framework to some of the FOSS4G communities in Argentina, such as Geoinquiet@s Argentina (OSGeo local chapter), OSM Argentina and GeochicasOSM.

## Our Vision
The world is experiencing a difficult time righ now and the role of free and open source software is essential for the development of many activities. From simple family communication to online conferences or the development of new platforms for education and geosciences, free software today is the protagonist of what happens to the world.
A FOSS4G with focus on the City of Buenos Aires undoubtedly marks a milestone in the calendar of international conferences. The city is a cultural benchmark in the region, making it a great opportunity to bring the free software communities of South America closer together. This approach will help strengthen ties between communities by fostering the exchange of experiences.
After going through a pandemic, the way of working, communicating and relating has changed worldwide, and free software has played a fundamental role in the development of human activities. The reunion between those who participate in the different communities will further strengthen the growth of free software, empowering, improving and developing new capabilities.
