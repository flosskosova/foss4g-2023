- **How do I know if there is space for the workshops?**

On the registration page you will be able to see the options and how many places are still available. The space in the training rooms is limited, so we can only offer a limited number of tickets.

- **I signed up for a workshop, what do I do now?**

It will be necessary to bring a laptop to participate in the workshops since they are totally practical, **do not forget it!**

We also recommend bringing an extension cord and a multi-outlet, since access to plugs is limited and everyone needs power at some point.
Although WiFi will be available, we recommend downloading the needed software before leaving for the venue.

- **Will there be WiFi during the event?**

Yes.

We will deliver the best possible quality connection, but as there will be many users at the same time, please connect only one device at a time (laptop or cell phone) and be mindful of its use.

- **If I already bought my ticket, how can I get an invoice / receipt for my payment?**

If you already bought your ticket, the receipt will be sent to you by email.

The invoices will be made by Geolibres Asociaci√≥n Civil. During the purchase process, the data for billing can be completed, such as the company name to which it is addressed and the tax ID number. Make sure the data is correct because once the ticket is purchased and the invoice is generated, it cannot be corrected.

Yes, the conference is open to any public interested in geomatics, free software, maps and communities.
