#### 1 - Gadime - Marble Cave arrival 10:00

The Marble Cave or the Gadime Cave is a karstic limestone cave in the village of Gadime e Ulët in the municipality of Lipljan in Kosovo. Much of it is still unexplored. The cave was found in 1966 by a villager, Ahmet Asllani, who was working on his garden.  
Gadime Cave is located within the marble limestones belonging to the Mesozoic era. The cave was formed during the tertiary period. In course of time the marble was subjected to cracking as a result of tectonic erosions.

The entrance to the cave is in two directions. The lower direction is relatively complicated and consists of 3 transverse channels, 2 parallel and curved corridors. The upper direction consists of two combined corridors. The total length of the cave is 1.260 m and its area is 56.25 ha

Ulpiana was an ancient Roman city located east of Prishtina.

The protection zone of the Archaeological Park has 96.23 ha and includes Justinopolis, constructed during the reign of Justinian.

During the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, Ulpiana reached a peak of development, thus bearing the name Municipum Ulpiana Splendissima. After an earthquake in 518, emperor Justinian renamed the city to Justiniana Secunda. In comparison to the earlier fortified Justiniana Prima.

#### 4 - Departure to Bear Sanctuary 12:00 arrival 12:25

The Bear Sanctuary Prishtina was founded in 2013 by Four Paws Austria in collaboration with KFOR, the City of Pristina, the Kosovar Ministry of Environment and the law firm Franke & Partner. The Bear Sanctuary Prishtina has currently in care 20 brown bears (as of January 2020). These ‘restaurant bears’ had been tracked down and registered by the government of Kosovo during the last few years and were rescued in 2013.
For many years, there was no law against keeping brown bears in Kosovo. All privately kept brown bears lived in small cages at restaurants; they were born mostly in the forests of Kosovo or Albania and snatched from their mothers by animal dealers. As restaurant bears they were supposed to attract customers.
