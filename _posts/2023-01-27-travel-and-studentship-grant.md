The Prizren Local Organizing Committee for the FOSS4G 2023 conference is excited to announce the launch of our Travel Grant and Studentship Grant programs. The conference, which is one of the most important events in the geospatial world, is committed to making the event as accessible as possible and promoting diversity and inclusion.

The [Travel Grant](/register/travel-grant) program is open to students and professionals around the world, and offers a chance to receive a full conference ticket as well as funding towards travel, accommodation, and other expenses. Criteria for the grant include experience in FOSS GIS, university enrollment, and more. Applications must be submitted by April 15th.

The [Studentship Program](/register/studentship-grant), on the other hand, will be offering 40 scholarships for students coming from Western Balkan that are enrolled in a university. The scholarship will include a full conference ticket (including 2 workshop tracks), accommodation, and an opportunity to volunteer. Criteria for the scholarship include being registered in any university in the Bachelor, Master and PhD level, having previous experience or future ambition to join the open GIS community, and being willing to contribute half a day volunteering throughout the conference week. Applications must be submitted by April 30th.
