#### One Day Left

Tomorrow is THE day!🎉

We're excited to finally kick off the #FOSS4G conference with workshop sessions covering a myriad of topics! We are starting with the first workshops in the morning, followed by an afternoon set. 🗓️

You have the opportunity to learn about managing your geospatial data with #PostgreSQL/#PostGIS, get introduced to #GeoServer, learn how to do #GeoSpatial with #Python, learn how to set up a Spatial Data Infrastructure (#SDI) with #OpenSourceSoftware using #OSGeoLive, and many more topics you can explore following the link [https://2023.foss4g.org/agenda/workshop_schedule/#](https://2023.foss4g.org/agenda/workshop_schedule/#). 🌐

Looking forward to the upcoming days, having thought leaders, industry experts, and passionate professionals come together to share insights, inspire, and shape the future! 🌟
