ðŸŽ‰ We are thrilled to announce that the 2023 Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial Conference (FOSS4G) will be hosted by FLOSSK in Prizren, Kosovo.

FOSS4G (<https://foss4g.org/>) is the annual event organized by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) since 2006 and one of the largest global meetings on geospatial software of the year.

FLOSSK is a Kosovo NGO promoting FLOSS since 2009.

Set in the foothills of the Sharr Mountains, Prizren was once a capital city, being a large cultural and trading center. The town has always been one of Kosovoâ€™s most beautiful cities, with unique roads, churches, mosques, and lots of old houses, which now serve for visual storytelling on the cityâ€™s history and tradition.

Local team looks forward to living up to Kosovoâ€™s renowned hospitality.ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ‡
