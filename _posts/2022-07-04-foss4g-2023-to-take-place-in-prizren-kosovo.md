🎉 We are thrilled to announce that the 2023 Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial Conference (FOSS4G) will be hosted by FLOSSK in Prizren, Kosovo.

FOSS4G (<https://foss4g.org/>) is the annual event organized by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) since 2006 and one of the largest global meetings on geospatial software of the year.

Free Libre Open Source Software Kosova (FLOSSK) is a Kosovo NGO promoting FLOSS since 2009.

Set in the foothills of the Sharr Mountains, Prizren was once a capital city, being a large cultural and trading center. The town has always been one of Kosovo’s most beautiful cities, with unique roads, churches, mosques, and lots of old houses, which now serve for visual storytelling on the city’s history and tradition.

Local team looks forward to living up to Kosovo’s renowned hospitality.🎇🎇
